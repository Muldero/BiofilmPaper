### Before running #############################################################

This code requires a folder tree to store return data. There must be a directory
  "Output" in the main directory, and it has to contain "Other", "POST_ATR",
  "POST_TRACK", "SIG_SAMPLE_TRAJ", and "SIG_TRACKER". The "Plot_Code" directory
  needs a "Plot_Data" directory and a "Final_Plots" directory which in turn must
  contain an "Images" directory. I apologize for the inconvinience, GitHub does
  not supoport empty folders.

RequiredPackages.csv contains a list of all the requisite pacakges with version 
  numbers. Newest versions of packages are automatically installed and loaded,
  but if this causes errors then the appropriate version may be required. If
  not accessible through CRAN they are available on request.

### Files ######################################################################

CompleteSourceScript.R - Running this file will load in all packages and run
  code to produce the data in our paper

BreakScript.R - Sourced in CompleteSourceScript.R. Called during loops. This
  is a blank script, intended to be used for diagnostics and to stop
  CompleteSourceScript.R safely.

Functions.R - Sourced in CompleteSourceScript.R. All of the functions required
  to run and analyze these simulations.

Master_Model_SourceOnly.R - Sourced in CompleteSourceScript.R. This script
  contains the code to perform simulations. Must be run by sourcing
  CompleteSourceScript.R.

Packages.R - Sourced in CompleteSourceScript.R. Loads all of the required
  packages. Sets library to the Packages directory.

### Directories ################################################################

Output - This contains several empty directies. Where all of the data generated
  by running CompleteSourceScript.R is stored.

Packages - Contains all of the source code for the packages used in this code.

Plot_Code - Code to generate the plots and other summary data reported in this
  paper. Scripts in that folder do not run independently. Initialization.R must
  be run before any of the plotting code will work.
