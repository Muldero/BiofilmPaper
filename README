### Files

CompleteSourceScript.R - Running this file will load in all packages and run
  code to produce the data in our paper

BreakScript.R - Sourced in CompleteSourceScript.R. Called during loops. This
  is a blank script, intended to be used for diagnostics and to stop
  CompleteSourceScript.R safely.

Functions.R - Sourced in CompleteSourceScript.R. All of the functions required
  to run and analyze these simulations.

Master_Model_SourceOnly.R - Sourced in CompleteSourceScript.R. This script
  contains the code to perform simulations. Must be run by sourcing
  CompleteSourceScript.R.

Packages.R - Sourced in CompleteSourceScript.R. Loads all of the required
  packages. Sets library to the Packages directory.

### Directories

Output - This contains several empty directies. Where all of the data generated
  by running CompleteSourceScript.R is stored.

Packages - Contains all of the source code for the packages used in this code.

Plot_Code - Code to generate the plots and other summary data reported in this
  paper. Scripts in that folder do not run independently. Initialization.R must
  be run before any of the plotting code will work.
